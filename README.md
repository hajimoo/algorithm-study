# Algorithm Training Lab

This repository documents my algorithm study notes and solutions for coding interviews (Japan / Global companies).

## Goals
- Improve structured problem-solving skills
- Build fast recall notes for online coding tests
- Practice implementation details (input, simulation, data structures)
- Keep reflections: what I misunderstood and how I fixed it

## Structure
- `fundamentals/` : input patterns, Python features, complexity notes
- `greedy/` : greedy concepts + problems + correctness reasoning
- `implementation/` : simulation patterns + problems
- `graph/` : stack/queue + DFS/BFS basics

## Study Method
1. Read the problem carefully
2. Check constraints → estimate time complexity
3. Decide a strategy (greedy / brute force / simulation / graph)
4. Implement
5. Compare with reference solution
6. Write reflection (what I missed, how I improved)
