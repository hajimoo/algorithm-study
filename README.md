# Algorithm Training Lab

This repository contains my algorithm training process for coding interviews (Japan / Global companies).

## Focus Areas

- Greedy algorithms
- Implementation & Simulation
- Time complexity analysis
- Graph traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Data structures

## Study Method

1. Analyze constraints
2. Estimate time complexity
3. Identify problem pattern
4. Implement
5. Compare with reference solution
6. Reflect and improve

The goal is not just solving problems,
but improving structured problem-solving skills.
