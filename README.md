# Algorithm Training Lab

This repository documents my structured algorithm training for coding interviews (Japan / Global companies).

## Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Improve time complexity estimation
- Develop structured thinking
- Practice greedy / implementation / graph algorithms

## Study Process

1. Read problem carefully
2. Check constraints
3. Estimate time complexity
4. Identify algorithm pattern
5. Implement solution
6. Compare with reference solution
7. Reflect on improvement points

This repository focuses not only on solving problems,
but on improving engineering thinking.
